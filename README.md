In today’s world, surveillance systems are 
becoming increasingly critical in public safety, disaster 
response, defense, and domestic security. This project 
introduces a low-cost, portable, and flexible surveillance rover 
that incorporates real-time video streaming and autonomous 
obstacle avoidance. The system combines embedded 
hardware, sensor-based automation, and wireless control to 
allow users to monitor and operate the rover in diverse 
environments. Its versatility makes it ideal for monitoring 
sensitive areas, hazardous locations, or even for educational 
and research purposes. The rover not only enhances 
situational awareness but also minimizes human exposure to 
potentially dangerous situations, thereby increasing safety and 
efficiency in mission-critical operations.
